# TvL Experiment
This application was built as part of my RSI 2021 project: "Effects of Priming on the Deployment of Attention in Visual Search". Users search for a T among Ls and click the left or right arrow key to specify its orientation. The shape of the T may change between trials from a sharp T to a dotted T.

# Technologies
Built using React JS and Firebase.
